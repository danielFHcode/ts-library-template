# TypeScript Library Template
A simple, git cloneble, starter template for creating a TypeScript library with vite.

## Usage
Simply clone this reposotory into your project:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/danielFHcode/ts-library-template.git
```
Then change the package name in the package.json file:
```json
"name": "your-lib-name",
```
Run `npm install` to install the dev dependecies:
```bash
npm install
```
Now you can start working on your library in the `src` directory, and run `dev` to start a development build:
```bash
npm run dev
```
When you're done, run `build` to build the project:
```bash
npm run build
```
(and don't forget to delete this file from the finall project)
